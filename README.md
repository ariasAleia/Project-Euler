# Project-Euler

Merging mathematics and computer science. In this project I want to learn more about these fields using Python. In each of the scripts you will find the solution of the mathematical challenges of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)



## Adding images to this repo

Why here? Well.. I am learning to write better repos so here we go:


With a great extension (_Markdown Paste_) we can just copy and paste screenshots. We paste just with ctrl + alt + v, we specify the location and done :D

![](images/euler.png)  


After that we can modify and add all the style and format that we want using html. For example here:

```html
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="150px" height="150px">
</p>
```
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="150px" height="150px">
</p>

```html
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>
```
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

## Adding Videos to this repo

It seems to be quite easy. Just drop and done. :D

## Now let's talk a little bit about commits

Jap... Commits are the way we tell the story. But in this case, there should not be mistery at all. Clear, direct and understandable. How? Well... Let's see how to do this.


* Imperative mode: Titles should be read like this: If applied, this commit will:
  * Fix bug
  * Add new feature
  * Replace usages of task
  
* Say what you made, why you made but don't say (at least not that much) how you made it

* Leave a blank line between the subject and the body of the commit

* Do not end the subject line with a period
  
* Capitalize the subject line
  
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters

* Wrap the body to 72 characters. 

* Sth really important: Commits must leave the total code functional (in a public branch at least).
  

Ok but what happens when we really don't know if sth will work or not or if suddenly we interrupt our code session and it's not totally working but anyway we want to save the current state? Then... Use private branches. 


All this info was taken from this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlp-9cdImSM). Yep. I like when intros are cool and that's why I kept watching the video.

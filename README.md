# Project-Euler

Merging mathematics and computer science. In this project I want to learn more about these fields using Python. In each of the scripts you will find the solution of the mathematical challenges of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)



## Adding images to this repo

Why here? Well.. I am learning to write better repos so here we go:


With a great extension (_Markdown Paste_) we can just copy and paste screenshots. We paste just with ctrl + alt + v, we specify the location and done :D

![](images/euler.png)  


After that we can modify and add all the style and format that we want using html. For example here:

```html
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>
```
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

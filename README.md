# Project-Euler

Merging mathematics and computer science. In this project I want to learn more about these fields using Python. In each of the scripts you will find the solution of the mathematical challenges of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)



## Adding images to this repo

Why here? Well.. I am learning to write better repos so here we go:


With a great extension (_Markdown Paste_) we can just copy and paste screenshots. We paste just with ctrl + alt + v, we specify the location and done :D

![](images/euler.png)  


After that we can modify and add all the style and format that we want using html. For example here:

```html
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="150px" height="150px">
</p>
```
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="150px" height="150px">
</p>

```html
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>
```
<p align="center">
<img src= "images/euler.png" alt="Euler" title="Euler" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

## Adding Videos to this repo

It seems to be quite easy. Just drop and done. :D

## Now let's talk a little bit about commits

Jap... Commits are the way we tell the story. But in this case, there should not be mistery at all. Clear, direct and understandable. How? Well... Let's see how to do this.


* Imperative mode: Titles should be read like this: If applied, this commit will:
  * Fix bug
  * Add new feature
  * Replace usages of task
  
* Say what you made, maybe why you made but don't say how you made it

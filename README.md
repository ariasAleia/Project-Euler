# Project-Euler

Merging mathematics and computer science. In this project I want to learn more about these fields using Python. In each of the scripts you will find the solution of the mathematical challenges of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)



And now trying a new commit from Lunux. Jap, it works exactly in the same way.
I kinda really like how this of commits and ideas and things creating themselves work.
